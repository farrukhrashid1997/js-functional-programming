**Map & Reduce**
- Map is a higher order function.
- Mapping data from one state, via transformation to another data. 
- First thing it does it, to create a new array. 
- Reduce is the one of the most versatile, powerful function in functional programming. 
- Reducing is basically if you have an initial empty array, and the function is to multiply all elements by two. Then in the first iteration you are combining/reducing the first element and the empty array. Next using the same array and another elemnt you combine/reduce. So basically two things are getting down to one thing. 
- The intiial array is called the accumulator, in reduce function (the result of each iteration)
- Our reduce, is two things to one, repeatedly through each element in the array.
